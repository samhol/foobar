### SPHPlayground framework
<?php echo Samiholck\skillLevelBar(100); ?>

**SPHPlayground** framework saw first daylight in 2009 or so. It was first 
only a small sample of tools for creating HTML components with PHP language. 
Nowadays it is an open source framework for developing interactive web 
applications and services in object oriented PHP. SPHPlayground is used as 
in all my latest PHP related projects.
